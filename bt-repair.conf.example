# Allow this script to automatically pair devices we own.
# They need to be listed in the known devices file "devices.txt".
# This can e.g. be necessary if the device (e.g. a pro controller)
# has been attached to another console (e.g. a Switch) in the meantime.
AUTO_PAIRING=true

# Exclude some devices from automatic pairing by listing
# a keyword from their listed device name.
# For now this variable is not a list but must be a single
# keyword which all of the blacklisted devices share in their name.

# Some devices need an agent to be able to be paired. E.g. keyboards.
# For now this variable is not a list but must be a single
# keyword which all of the respective devices share in their config-name.
