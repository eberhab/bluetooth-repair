# Allow this script to automatically pair devices we own.
# They need to be listed in the known devices file (see $DEVFILE).
# This can e.g. be necessary if the device (e.g. a pro controller)
# has been attached to another consolen (e.g. a Switch) in the meantime.
AUTO_PAIRING=true

# Exclude some devices from automatic pairing by listing
# a keyword from their listed device name.
# For now this variable is not a list but must be a single
# keyword which all of the blacklisted devices share in their name.
AUTO_PAIRING_BLACKLIST="DoNotPair"

# Some devices need an agent to be able to be paired. E.g. keyboards.
# For now this variable is not a list but must be a single
# keyword which all of the respective devices share in their config-name.

# Number of failed connection attempts for a specific device until we
# try to re-pair it. This is e.g. useful if a controller is used on
# multiple devices. This only works if a list of pairable devices is
# specified and AUTO_PAIRING is true.

# Notify an external handler of the discovery of new devices and log messages
# This is needed for agent based paring. Path of handler can be absolute
